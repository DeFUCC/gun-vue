# Example use of Gun-Vue building blocks to make capable apps

This is just a basic HTML file that should be readable even without knowing it's syntax.

## [App](./app.html)

This is an example of using the whole `app` build from Gun-Vue palette so that everything is ready to explore with just a couple of lines in a text file. The resulting code can be easily hosted on a web-server, but also can be opened just from downloaded local `file://`. Instant fun!
