Component documentation built with Histoire now is the main place for GunVue development and showcasing. It makes us think in independent modules and build reusable pieces of Vue code. The setup is quite convenient and robust. We've got rid of the Vitepress composables documentation completely and moved the autogenerated JSDocs to a separate story inside the components source.
