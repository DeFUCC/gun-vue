WIP, no docs for now. Refer to [@gun-vue repo](https://github.com/davay42/gun-vue) and the use of the components in the [@gun-vue/demo](https://github.com/davay42/gun-vue/tree/master/demo)

## How to use

1. Install the components library: `npm i @gun-vue/components`
2. Import a component to your Vue 3 project: `import {RelayPulse} from '@gun-vue/components'`
3. Use the component in your SFC template: `<relay-pulse />`
4. Have fun combining dufferent components with shared Gun state.
