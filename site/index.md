## Components

### Try [Embedded components](/components/)

## Composables

Easy to use Vue 3 Composition API composable functions to be used in a Vue `<script setup>` environment. There are basic bindings to Gun DB capabilities as well as some other low and high level abstractions.

- Low level functions are like `useSvgMouse()` for user presence indications.
- High level are funcs like `useFeed()` that loads a feed of immutable hash-adressed posts under a certain tag

## Demo

The most straightforward way of using the `@gun-vue/components` is to mount them in your Vue 3 + Vite app. It then will build a small set of files that can be easily deployed at any host (centralised or distributed).

Here's the demo app empowered with some `vite` plugins like `vite-plugin-pages` and `windicss`. It elaborates the client-side routing to connect the pieces together and make urls a powerful tool to share data across gun network.
