But it's not a bit deal as there's a solution for the problem. All we need is the virtual scroll list component, that renders only the messages that are currently displayed and makes it easy to have even thousands of messages without bloating DOM. The second part of the equation is debouncing the sort function so it will kick in once we have some time to order the messages. These two improvements make Gun-Vue chat components quite useful in real world apps.
