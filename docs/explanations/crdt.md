# Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)

A **CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type)** is a type of data structure designed for distributed systems, allowing multiple users or systems to update data simultaneously without conflicts. CRDTs ensure that all replicas of the data eventually converge to the same state, regardless of the order of updates, **without requiring coordination like locks or central servers**.

## Benefits of CRDTs

- **Offline & Distributed Editing** – Users can make changes offline, and their updates will sync correctly when they reconnect.
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution** – Merges updates automatically without requiring manual intervention.
- **Scalability** – Works efficiently in applications where many users update data at the same time.
- **Strong Consistency Guarantees** – Ensures that all users eventually see the same data without complex synchronization mechanisms.
