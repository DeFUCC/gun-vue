## Let's build our first Gun-Vue web-app

1. Create an empty text file and call it `app.html`
2. Copy and paste this code into it.

<<< ../../examples/app.html{8-19,26-30}

3. Change in the `#app` section and modify the chat topic if you want.
4. Save the file and open it with any browser. Welcome to your first p2p chat app!
