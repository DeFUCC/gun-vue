### Run on any device

All you need to run a Gun relay is a `NodeJS >=16.x` environment with `npm` package manager to import and run the script. It's already up and running in major clouds, but you may need to **[install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** on your computer, or **[configure a RaspberryPi](https://dev.to/bogdaaamn/run-your-nodejs-application-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi-4jnn)**.

- **Computer**

  Open your terminal and check the version of Node with `node -v`. You may need to **[Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)** or [update it](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

- **Android device**

  You can easily run NodeJS apps on an Android phone with **[Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)** app. Consider installing it from **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)** to get the fresh and stable version.

- **RaspberryPi**

  Flash your image and **[configure your Pi](https://dev.to/bogdaaamn/run-your-nodejs-application-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi-4jnn)** to run a local Gun server
