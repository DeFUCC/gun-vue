Now we have the basic setup for the projects section development, we can start implementing real Gun database connections. Users can publish their own projects to the rooms and update them at any time with any information. You can change the color of your project just by one click, but only if it's yours. 

There's p2p graph database working with all the basic cryptography for user keys, signatures and certificates. It's all we need to start building reactive apps for many use cases.

My idea is to let people publicly develop their projects in order to inform others and get any support from the communities of others. And yet the keys to the rooms may belong to others, their projects are just shared there by the link from the user's independent graph space with use of the certificate issued by the host.

We've also added the https://fusejs.io fuzzy search to filter the reactive list of all the projects of the current room. This setup is powerful enough to be easily built upon. Let's do it!
