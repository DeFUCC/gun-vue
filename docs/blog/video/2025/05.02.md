Welcome back! In this second part, Davay dives deep into Gun-Vue, the powerful front-end toolkit for building decentralized, encrypted, and offline-first web apps with Gun.js. Following the vibrant keypair avatars from Part 1, this episode shows how to derive, store, share, and authenticate identities‚Äîall using lightweight files and passkeys.

‚ú® What's Inside:

- Gun-Vue: one-file frontend toolkit (~1.7MB!) for peer-to-peer apps.

- Create and share encrypted keypairs via WebKey or PNG avatars.

- Instant login from links, QR codes, or local files.

- Generate keys from custom passphrases (key derivation).

- Send secure DMs using shared phrases with end-to-end encryption.

- Works seamlessly in-browser or as a PWA (Progressive Web App).

- Fully open source, modular, and available on NPM.

Whether you‚Äôre building dApps, secure chat, or agent-based systems, Gun-Vue makes decentralized identity and communication ridiculously simple.
