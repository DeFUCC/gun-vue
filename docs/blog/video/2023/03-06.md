We have a bunch of new features and quite stable builds for everyone to have pleasure using. Yes, the design is far from ideal, the app is still more like a prototype, but it's working! And it's getting better as it grows.

This is a high level overview of all the development happening in the project recently. Now we have more features to play with. Share files via WebTorrent, jump between relays to find the most fast and reliable for you, notice the projects growing deeper and deeper.

You can try the new release here
