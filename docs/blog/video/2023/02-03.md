We're building a decentralized web-apps ecosystem. Gun is a reactive p2p graph CRDT database and Vue is a versatile and easy to learn JS framework. Combining both of them we can make almost any application we can imagine! By sharing the composable APIs and pluggable components we enable everyone to build their own apps with their own space in the decentralized graph. 

Just create a free project at any JS playground and start building your own custom web-app. I used StackBlitz this time. Start with https://stackblitz.com/fork/vue . And start dropping https://gun-vue.js.org/components there. My 5 min app is neatly published at https://gun-vue.stackblitz.io 

Try it yourself now! https://stackblitz.com/edit/gun-vue?file=src%2FApp.vue

The toolbox is completely free and open-source. Consider supporting us staying on this path for long! https://github.com/sponsors/davay42
