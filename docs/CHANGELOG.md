# @gun-vue/docs

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Better docs with video blog and more!

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- All actual js code is in the src folder. App, components and composables are just mere packages.

  The Typedoc + Vitepress documentation moved out to docs folder.

  Components will be documented there too, so we could remove Histoire from the system making the build process so much faster and more stable. Which makes it suitable for the GitHub Actions build pipeline from source to pages.
