## What is @gun-vue?

@gun-vue is a open collection of interconnected building blocks for making a whole range of decentralized apps for online and offline collaboration. It's a place where we can feel the nature of distributed networking and have fun together!

[Gun](https://gun.eco) is a CRDT based distributed graph database, [Vue](https://vuejs.org) is a reactive JS UI framework. And SEA is web-browser cryptography adapter. Together they evolve into an ecosystem of multiple app levels.

The project is committed to give all the basic tools for everyone to participate in exploring this new graph universe. You can find your own way in it for yourself.

There code is organised into distinct layers in the [@gun-vue npmjs.com organisation](https://www.npmjs.com/org/gun-vue) for you to install and use in your P2P apps.


## What is Gun-Vue? It's a p2p web app toolbox!

It's free and open-source for everyone's pleasure.

Gun-Vue is a set of tools to explore the power of p2p web apps powered with the most advanced open-source web dev stack.

Web is our home and the app lives in the browser. At the end we have just an set of HTML, CSS and JS files that connect peers and let them share hashed, signed and encrypted information freely. But there's a whole build setup that makes it all happen.

We're using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) to create reactive UIs and [GUN](https://gun.eco) to have a reactive p2p database right at the client. We are building on these and many other open-source web-technologies to have a direct experience with using real peer-to-peer communications right in the browser tab.

Of course, there are some servers involved, they're called relays. But they're completely interchangeable and are even not supposed to store any data (though they can). It means that you can own you data 100%.
