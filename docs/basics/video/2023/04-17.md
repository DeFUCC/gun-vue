Today we are adding a new feature to the app by expanding QR Code components section. We extract the basic logic from the LoadQR component to the `useQR` composable, then display all the components at app routes. Now anyone can start creating and parsing QR code immediately and completely client side. It's just bare bones start for a whole space of visual data transfer and verification (!). What about signed QR messages with delivery verification by certificates built right in the link?

Also the `v.0.15.0` updated build system enables new ways of creating interactive docs with Vitepress. We just touched that topic now. This will be covered in next videos. So stay tuned!
