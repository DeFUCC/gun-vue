It's the first approach to build a gift exchange platform. So users can propose a donation to other user for them to approve the transaction. We start by creating routes and basic logic and proceed to building Gun lists with content-addressing and user signatures. We'll evaluate a couple of ideas and finally get a MVP of sending and receiving gift records. It's just the first steps as this system will grow into a public projects funding system. So the donations will be linked to projects and will have to be used to get them done. But we'll have to build the project management system too. That's going to be next.
