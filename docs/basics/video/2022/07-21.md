The very basic functionality to create and list user project has been added to @gun-vue project. Here is the memo for you (and me) to remember the way we can expand the power of the p2p library. I review the layers from the top: routes and navigation, then the components and then the main logic is built in the composables. 

In 16 minutes I will show how the layers are built, how they are connected with each other. We got the certificates for users to write to their personal spaces in the current room. For now it's only title, but there will be much more. Projects will include events, objects, tasks and more! I have to invent the way to connect everything together, but make it discoverable and useful for global stats collections.
