We begin with final build stages and publish the v.0.6.0 of @gun-vue project live. Then there's an overview of some new and updated features of the app and all it's layers. We got `Stability +10` and great UI design improvements since v.0.5.0. I've added full zip-file support meaning you can upload and download zip-files with you posts and the app will easily handle them client-side. 

You'll see the more reliable version of the Space, fast and beautiful Feeds and some Users browsing experience. I try to make everything  as modular as I can, so you can imagine how you could combine all these blocks to create some fun p2p web-apps yourself. This power is just one import away!
