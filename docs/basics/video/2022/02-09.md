Today we present a new iteration on merging a reactive p2p database with a reactive UI framework together to form a toolbox for everyone to build upon. With v 0.7 we introduce the concept of rooms, that are separate SEA key pairs for use with certificates. Any logged in user can do create some records inside the app room based of a set of certificates, restricting the posting rules. Posts, spaces, users and even rooms are already easily addable to any room by any user. And anyone can create a new room to fill up as he/she wishes. It becomes more and more fun!
