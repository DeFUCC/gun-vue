A collection of feature-focused code - **composables** (business logic), **components** (UI), and **routes** (navigation) - for building Offline-First, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using [Gun](https://gun.eco), [SEA](https://gun.eco/docs/SEA), and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org).

> This code is part of [**Gun-Vue: The Peer-to-Peer Web App Toolkit**](https://github.com/DeFUCC/gun-vue).

[**ðŸ“± Try the Gun-Vue: Demo App!**](https://gun-vue.js.org/app) and check out its repo at [gun-vue/app](https://github.com/DeFUCC/gun-vue/tree/master/app) to see how these pieces come together into a functioning Single Page Peer-to-Peer Web App.

## Explanation of Gun-Vue: Features

### Example Structure

Below is a simple example of how **Gun-Vue: Feature** is organized:

```plaintext
/src/widget/
  â”œ useWidget.js      (Composable)
  â”œ WidgetDisplay.vue (Component)
  â”œ routes.js          (Route definitions)
  â”œ README.md          (Feature-specific notes & usage)
  â”” ...
```

### [**Gun-Vue: Composables**](https://github.com/DeFUCC/gun-vue/tree/master/composables)
> [Typedoc Reference](https://gun-vue.js.org/reference/typedoc/modules.html)
  
  Reusable logic built with the Vue 3 Composition API. Manages Gun database interactions, SEA encryption, and reactive state.


### [**Gun-Vue: Components**](https://github.com/DeFUCC/gun-vue/tree/master/components)

  Vue Single-File Components (SFC) providing ready-to-use UI powered by UnoCSS, Pug templates, and your featureâ€™s composables.  

### **Routes**

  File-based routing that ties composables and components into a complete user flow. Typically exported from `routes.js` and mapped to URLs in your appâ€™s router.

## How to Get Started

### StackBlitz Starter Project  
Launch the **[Gun-Vue: StackBlitz Starter Project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/gun-vue?embed=1&file=src/App.vue)** for a quick, no-setup demo highlighting core Gun-Vue features in a basic Vue 3 app.

### Build It Yourself

1. **Clone the Monorepo & Install**  
   Refer to the [main Gun-Vue README](https://github.com/DeFUCC/gun-vue) for steps on cloning, installing dependencies, and running the development environment with `pnpm`.

2. **Pick a Feature**  
   Each subfolder in `src/` (e.g., `accounts`, `chat`, `posts`) is a self-contained feature. Explore its `README.md` or code to understand how composables, components, and routes are organized.

3. **Extend or Create New Features**  
   Mix and match existing logic, or develop new composables and components for your own P2P use cases. Simply **add or modify** a folder here, then **import** it into your main appâ€™s router or pages.
