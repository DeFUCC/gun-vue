## Chat

Includes both public threads and private messaging.

### Public chats

Anyone can start a particular topic. Then anyone can write into it. @general is considered the string point, but due to the nature of public chat it won't be useable in case there are thousands of random people. But going deeper with the topics is a way to expand the conversations and make them more productive.

### Private chats

You can communicate securely to others using yours and theirs elliptic private keys.  Messages are signed and mixed in daily batches. The content can be anything.
